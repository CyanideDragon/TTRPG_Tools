Exceptio error codes.

# For the time being, only add exception handling for the purposes of developing the program, or where it may be frequently needed. the actual exception handling should be done
# in the area that it could happen. This document is for error codes

"""
EX:
    ERROR_1 = "Please choose a number"
    errors should be globals an immutable like constants. The error text should provide corrective action.
